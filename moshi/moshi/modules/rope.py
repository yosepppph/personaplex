    RoPE rotations compose additively in angle, so rotating a key baked at
    position `p` by an extra `shift` yields a key that behaves as if it sat at
    position `p + shift`. Used by the pinned-prefix "Fix A": re-place the prompt
    keys just before the rolling window (a constant `shift` per prefix slot) so
    their distance to the query stays within `context` and never extrapolates.
    `shift == 0` is an exact identity (bf16 round-trips losslessly through f32),
    so unshifted (conversation) slots are returned unchanged.
